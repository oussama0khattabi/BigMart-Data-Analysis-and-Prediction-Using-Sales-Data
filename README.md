# BigMart Sales Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict the sales of various products across different BigMart stores using historical data. The dataset contains information such as product attributes, store attributes, and sales figures for different products in various stores.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of the following attributes:
- **Item_Identifier**: Unique identifier for the product
- **Item_Weight**: Weight of the product
- **Item_Fat_Content**: Fat content of the product (Low Fat, Regular)
- **Item_Visibility**: Percentage of total display area of all products in a store allocated to the particular product
- **Item_Type**: Category of the product (e.g., Dairy, Soft Drinks, Meat)
- **Item_MRP**: Maximum Retail Price (price at which the product is sold to the customer)
- **Outlet_Identifier**: Unique identifier for the store
- **Outlet_Establishment_Year**: Year in which the store was established
- **Outlet_Size**: Size of the store (Small, Medium, High)
- **Outlet_Location_Type**: Type of city where the store is located (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3)
- **Outlet_Type**: Type of outlet (Supermarket Type1, Supermarket Type2, Supermarket Type3, Grocery Store)
- **Item_Outlet_Sales**: Sales of the product in the particular store

## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately forecast the sales of products in different BigMart stores. This model will help the management in making informed decisions regarding inventory management, stock replenishment, and sales strategies.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Feature engineering (if necessary)
   - Scale numerical variables (if necessary)
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Understand the distribution of sales
   - Analyze the relationship between features and sales
   - Identify patterns and insights
3. **Feature Selection**:
   - Select relevant features for modeling
   - Drop irrelevant or redundant features
4. **Model Selection and Training**:
   - Choose appropriate regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
   - Train the models using the training dataset
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Optimize hyperparameters to improve model performance
6. **Final Model Selection**:
   - Select the best performing model based on evaluation results
