BigMart Sales Prediction Project
-Overview
This project aims to predict the sales of various products in different outlets of BigMart. The dataset contains historical sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores located in different cities. Leveraging this data, we intend to build a predictive model that can accurately forecast the sales of products to help BigMart optimize their inventory and improve overall sales performance.
Dataset

The dataset consists of the following features:

  Item_Identifier: Unique identifier for each product
  Item_Weight: Weight of the product
  Item_Fat_Content: Whether the product is low fat or regular
  Item_Visibility: Percentage of total display area in the store allocated to the particular product
  Item_Type: Category of the product
  Item_MRP: Maximum Retail Price of the product
  Outlet_Identifier: Unique identifier for each store
  Outlet_Establishment_Year: Year of establishment of the store
  Outlet_Size: Size of the store
  Outlet_Location_Type: Type of city where the store is located
  Outlet_Type: Type of outlet (grocery store, supermarket, etc.)
  Item_Outlet_Sales: Sales of the product in the particular store

-Goals
    Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handle missing values, outliers, and perform feature engineering.
    Exploratory Data Analysis: Understand the relationships between different features and the target variable.
    Feature Selection: Identify the most important features that influence sales.
    Model Building: Develop predictive models using regression techniques such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
    Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of models using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and R-squared.
    Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the parameters of the best performing model to improve predictive accuracy.

-Tools and Technologies
    Programming Language: Python
    Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
    Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
    Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook
